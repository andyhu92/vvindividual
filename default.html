		<h3><a href="#/food">I love Chinese FOOOOOD</a></h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:30px">I am an international student in America and I really miss my country's dishes, yeah, the Chinese foods. So I am gradually becoming a cook.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:30px">Chinese people love to eat and China boasts one of the world's greatest cuisines. During the long development of Chinese eating culture, many practices have evolved that foreign visitors may find quite different from what they are used to and even consider weird."The Chinese eat everything with four legs, except tables, and everything that flies — except airplanes". Find out about some of the unique dishes of a nation who are willing to eat just about anything. Wild animals, household pets, reptiles, amphibians, mollusks, insects, fish and birds, you name it — if they can find a tasty way to prepare it, the Chinese will eat it with gusto.</p></div>

		<h3><a href="#/travel">Go Travel!</a></h3>
		<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:30px">Travelling, for me, is same as reading books. Travel gives me time to think, observe and learn new things - culture, food, history. Travelling is the best way of having new experiences. Imagine climbing  a mountain or going for a walk on the beach, or going to a museum or going to a national park. Imagine the infinite possibilities travelling opens up for you. In our daily life we don't really have time to think about things that matter and travelling gives you time to think about, to reflect, to wonder about the big questions of your life.  Travelling is the best way of gaining new perspective, new points of view about leading your life. You meet so many people along your journey and they all influence you in some way. You forget about your problem for a small amount of time and understand that there are a lot of people who are struggling for bare necessities in life.</p>
